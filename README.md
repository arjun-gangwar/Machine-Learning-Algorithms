# Machine-Learning-Algorithms
Some algorithms implemented from scratch in Python Numpy. Algorithms implemented are as follows :-

1. Simple Linear Regression
2. Multi-Varient Linear Regression
3. Simple Logistic Regression 
4. Simple Neural Network

These exercises were part of the course "Introduction to Machine Learning" by Andrew Ng. Datasets are included in the folders. To run any of the algorithm, Download the repository and run the jupyter notebook.
